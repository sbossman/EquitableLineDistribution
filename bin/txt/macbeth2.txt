Scene 4
=======
[Banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth,
Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.]


MACBETH
You know your own degrees; sit down. At first
And last, the hearty welcome.	[They sit.]

LORDS  Thanks to your Majesty.

MACBETH
Ourself will mingle with society
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.

LADY_MACBETH
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
For my heart speaks they are welcome.

[Enter First Murderer to the door.]


MACBETH
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even. Here I'll sit i' th' midst.
Be large in mirth. Anon we'll drink a measure
The table round. [He approaches the Murderer.] There's
blood upon thy face.

FIRST_MURDERER  'Tis Banquo's then.

MACBETH
'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatched?

FIRST_MURDERER
My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.

MACBETH
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats,
Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance.
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

FIRST_MURDERER
Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.

MACBETH, [aside]
Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air.
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears.--But Banquo's safe?

FIRST_MURDERER
Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,
With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
The least a death to nature.

MACBETH  Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies. The worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow
We'll hear ourselves again.	[Murderer exits.]

LADY_MACBETH  My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold
That is not often vouched, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.

[Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth's place.]


MACBETH, [to Lady Macbeth]  Sweet remembrancer!--
Now, good digestion wait on appetite
And health on both!

LENNOX  May 't please your Highness sit.

MACBETH
Here had we now our country's honor roofed,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present,
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance.

ROSS  His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Please 't your
Highness
To grace us with your royal company?

MACBETH
The table's full.

LENNOX  Here is a place reserved, sir.

MACBETH  Where?

LENNOX
Here, my good lord. What is 't that moves your
Highness?

MACBETH
Which of you have done this?

LORDS  What, my good lord?

MACBETH, [to the Ghost]
Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake
Thy gory locks at me.

ROSS
Gentlemen, rise. His Highness is not well.

LADY_MACBETH
Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus
And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well. If much you note him
You shall offend him and extend his passion.
Feed and regard him not.	[Drawing Macbeth aside.]
Are you a man?

MACBETH
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appall the devil.

LADY_MACBETH  O, proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear.
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
You look but on a stool.

MACBETH
Prithee, see there. Behold, look! [To the Ghost.] Lo,
how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.--
If charnel houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.	[Ghost exits.]

LADY_MACBETH  What, quite unmanned in folly?

MACBETH
If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY_MACBETH  Fie, for shame!

MACBETH
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' th' olden time,
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been performed
Too terrible for the ear. The time has been
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end. But now they rise again
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
And push us from our stools. This is more strange
Than such a murder is.

LADY_MACBETH  My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH  I do forget.--
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to
all.
Then I'll sit down.--Give me some wine. Fill full.

[Enter Ghost.]

I drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
Would he were here! To all, and him we thirst,
And all to all.

LORDS  Our duties, and the pledge.
[They raise their drinking cups.]

MACBETH, [to the Ghost]
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee.
Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with.

LADY_MACBETH  Think of this, good
peers,
But as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH, [to the Ghost]  What man dare, I dare.
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble. Or be alive again
And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mock'ry, hence!	[Ghost exits.]
Why so, being gone,
I am a man again.--Pray you sit still.

LADY_MACBETH
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good
meeting
With most admired disorder.

MACBETH  Can such things be
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
When mine is blanched with fear.

ROSS  What sights, my
lord?

LADY_MACBETH
I pray you, speak not. He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him. At once, good night.
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.

LENNOX  Good night, and better health
Attend his Majesty.

LADY_MACBETH  A kind good night to all.
[Lords and all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth exit.]

MACBETH
It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move, and trees to
speak.
Augurs and understood relations have
By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought
forth
The secret'st man of blood.--What is the night?

LADY_MACBETH
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

MACBETH
How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?

LADY_MACBETH  Did you send to him, sir?

MACBETH
I hear it by the way; but I will send.
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will tomorrow
(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters.
More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know
By the worst means the worst. For mine own good,
All causes shall give way. I am in blood
Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand,
Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.

LADY_MACBETH
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
We are yet but young in deed.
[They exit.]

Scene 5
=======
[Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.]


FIRST_WITCH
Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.

HECATE
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
Saucy and overbold, how did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death,
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never called to bear my part
Or show the glory of our art?
And which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now. Get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i' th' morning. Thither he
Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and everything beside.
I am for th' air. This night I'll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vap'rous drop profound.
I'll catch it ere it come to ground,
And that, distilled by magic sleights,
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know, security
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
[Music and a song.]
Hark! I am called. My little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.	[Hecate exits.]
[Sing within "Come away, come away," etc.]

FIRST_WITCH
Come, let's make haste. She'll soon be back again.
[They exit.]

Scene 6
=======
[Enter Lennox and another Lord.]


LENNOX
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret farther. Only I say
Things have been strangely borne. The gracious
Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
And the right valiant Banquo walked too late,
Whom you may say, if 't please you, Fleance killed,
For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? Damned fact,
How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely, too,
For 'twould have angered any heart alive
To hear the men deny 't. So that I say
He has borne all things well. And I do think
That had he Duncan's sons under his key
(As, an 't please heaven, he shall not) they should
find
What 'twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.
But peace. For from broad words, and 'cause he
failed
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?

LORD  The son of Duncan
(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)
Lives in the English court and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
That, by the help of these (with Him above
To ratify the work), we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage, and receive free honors,
All which we pine for now. And this report
Hath so exasperate the King that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX  Sent he to Macduff?

LORD
He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"
The cloudy messenger turns me his back
And hums, as who should say "You'll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer."

LENNOX  And that well might
Advise him to a caution t' hold what distance
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed.

LORD  I'll send my prayers with him.
[They exit.]


ACT 4
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Thunder. Enter the three Witches.]


FIRST_WITCH
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.

SECOND_WITCH
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined.

THIRD_WITCH
Harpier cries "'Tis time, 'tis time!"

FIRST_WITCH
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poisoned entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' th' charmed pot.
[The Witches circle the cauldron.]

ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

SECOND_WITCH
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake.
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

THIRD_WITCH
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witch's mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravined salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digged i' th' dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat and slips of yew
Slivered in the moon's eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-delivered by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron
For th' ingredience of our cauldron.

ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

SECOND_WITCH
Cool it with a baboon's blood.
Then the charm is firm and good.

[Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.]


HECATE
O, well done! I commend your pains,
And everyone shall share i' th' gains.
And now about the cauldron sing
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.
[Music and a song: "Black Spirits," etc. Hecate exits.]

SECOND_WITCH
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks.

[Enter Macbeth.]


MACBETH
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is 't you do?

ALL  A deed without a name.

MACBETH
I conjure you by that which you profess
(Howe'er you come to know it), answer me.
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches, though the yeasty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up,
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown
down,
Though castles topple on their warders' heads,
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations, though the
treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.

FIRST_WITCH  Speak.

SECOND_WITCH  Demand.

THIRD_WITCH  We'll answer.

FIRST_WITCH
Say if th' hadst rather hear it from our mouths
Or from our masters'.

MACBETH  Call 'em. Let me see 'em.

FIRST_WITCH
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderers' gibbet throw
Into the flame.

ALL  Come high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show.

[Thunder. First Apparition, an Armed Head.]


MACBETH
Tell me, thou unknown power--

FIRST_WITCH  He knows thy
thought.
Hear his speech but say thou naught.

FIRST_APPARITION
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff!
Beware the Thane of Fife! Dismiss me. Enough.
[He descends.]

MACBETH
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks.
Thou hast harped my fear aright. But one word
more--

FIRST_WITCH
He will not be commanded. Here's another
More potent than the first.

[Thunder. Second Apparition, a Bloody Child.]


SECOND_APPARITION  Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!--

MACBETH  Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.

SECOND_APPARITION
Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.	[He descends.]

MACBETH
Then live, Macduff; what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure
And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live,
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.

[Thunder. Third Apparition, a Child Crowned, with a tree
in his hand.]

What is this
That rises like the issue of a king
And wears upon his baby brow the round
And top of sovereignty?

ALL  Listen but speak not to 't.

THIRD_APPARITION
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until
Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill
Shall come against him.	[He descends.]

MACBETH  That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earthbound root? Sweet bodements, good!
Rebellious dead, rise never till the Wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing. Tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?

ALL  Seek to know no more.

MACBETH
I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know!
[Cauldron sinks. Hautboys.]
Why sinks that cauldron? And what noise is this?

FIRST_WITCH  Show.

SECOND_WITCH  Show.

THIRD_WITCH  Show.

ALL
Show his eyes and grieve his heart.
Come like shadows; so depart.

[A show of eight kings, the eighth king with a glass in
his hand, and Banquo last.]


MACBETH
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo. Down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former.--Filthy hags,
Why do you show me this?--A fourth? Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to th' crack of doom?
Another yet? A seventh? I'll see no more.
And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
Which shows me many more, and some I see
That twofold balls and treble scepters carry.
Horrible sight! Now I see 'tis true,
For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me
And points at them for his.
[The Apparitions disappear.]
What, is this so?

FIRST_WITCH
Ay, sir, all this is so. But why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites
And show the best of our delights.
I'll charm the air to give a sound
While you perform your antic round,
That this great king may kindly say
Our duties did his welcome pay.
[Music. The Witches dance and vanish.]

MACBETH
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!--
Come in, without there.

[Enter Lennox.]


LENNOX  What's your Grace's will?

MACBETH
Saw you the Weird Sisters?

LENNOX  No, my lord.

MACBETH
Came they not by you?

LENNOX  No, indeed, my lord.

MACBETH
Infected be the air whereon they ride,
And damned all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse. Who was 't came by?

LENNOX
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.

MACBETH  Fled to England?

LENNOX  Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH, [aside]
Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits.
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and
done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
Seize upon Fife, give to th' edge o' th' sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come bring me where they are.
[They exit.]

Scene 2
=======
[Enter Macduff's Wife, her Son, and Ross.]


LADY_MACDUFF
What had he done to make him fly the land?

ROSS
You must have patience, madam.

LADY_MACDUFF  He had none.
His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.

ROSS  You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

LADY_MACDUFF
Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear, and nothing is the love,
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.

ROSS  My dearest coz,
I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' th' season. I dare not speak much
further;
But cruel are the times when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move--I take my leave of you.
Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
To what they were before.--My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you.

LADY_MACDUFF
Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.

ROSS
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I take my leave at once.	[Ross exits.]

LADY_MACDUFF  Sirrah, your father's dead.
And what will you do now? How will you live?

SON
As birds do, mother.

LADY_MACDUFF  What, with worms and flies?

SON
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

LADY_MACDUFF
Poor bird, thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.

SON
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set
for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.

LADY_MACDUFF
Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?

SON  Nay, how will you do for a husband?

LADY_MACDUFF
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

SON  Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

LADY_MACDUFF  Thou speak'st with all thy wit,
And yet, i' faith, with wit enough for thee.

SON  Was my father a traitor, mother?

LADY_MACDUFF  Ay, that he was.

SON  What is a traitor?

LADY_MACDUFF  Why, one that swears and lies.

SON  And be all traitors that do so?

LADY_MACDUFF  Every one that does so is a traitor
and must be hanged.

SON  And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

LADY_MACDUFF  Every one.

SON  Who must hang them?

LADY_MACDUFF  Why, the honest men.

SON  Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there
are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest
men and hang up them.

LADY_MACDUFF  Now God help thee, poor monkey! But
how wilt thou do for a father?

SON  If he were dead, you'd weep for him. If you would
not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a
new father.

LADY_MACDUFF  Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

[Enter a Messenger.]


MESSENGER
Bless you, fair dame. I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here. Hence with your little ones!
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve
you!
I dare abide no longer.	[Messenger exits.]

LADY_MACDUFF  Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defense
To say I have done no harm?

[Enter Murderers.]

What are these faces?

MURDERER  Where is your husband?

LADY_MACDUFF
I hope in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.

MURDERER  He's a traitor.

SON
Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!

MURDERER  What, you egg?
[Stabbing him.] Young fry of treachery!

SON  He has killed
me, mother.
Run away, I pray you.
[Lady Macduff exits, crying "Murder!" followed by the
Murderers bearing the Son's body.]

Scene 3
=======
[Enter Malcolm and Macduff.]


MALCOLM
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.

MACDUFF  Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,
Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland, and yelled out
Like syllable of dolor.

MALCOLM  What I believe, I'll wail;
What know, believe; and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest. You have loved him well.
He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but
something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
T' appease an angry god.

MACDUFF
I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM  But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your
pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of
grace,
Yet grace must still look so.

MACDUFF  I have lost my hopes.

MALCOLM
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking? I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.

MACDUFF  Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy
wrongs;
The title is affeered.--Fare thee well, lord.
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot.

MALCOLM  Be not offended.
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds. I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.

MACDUFF  What should he be?

MALCOLM
It is myself I mean, in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.

MACDUFF  Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned
In evils to top Macbeth.

MALCOLM  I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name. But there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.

MACDUFF  Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny. It hath been
Th' untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours. You may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
And yet seem cold--the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough. There cannot be
That vulture in you to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclined.

MALCOLM  With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels, and this other's house;
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more, that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.

MACDUFF  This avarice
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear.
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
Of your mere own. All these are portable,
With other graces weighed.

MALCOLM
But I have none. The king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temp'rance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.

MACDUFF  O Scotland, Scotland!

MALCOLM
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.

MACDUFF  Fit to govern?
No, not to live.--O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed
And does blaspheme his breed?--Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,
Oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well.
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Hath banished me from Scotland.--O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!

MALCOLM  Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From overcredulous haste. But God above
Deal between thee and me, for even now
I put myself to thy direction and
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
The devil to his fellow, and delight
No less in truth than life. My first false speaking
Was this upon myself. What I am truly
Is thine and my poor country's to command--
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?

MACDUFF
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.

[Enter a Doctor.]


MALCOLM  Well, more anon.--
Comes the King forth, I pray you?

DOCTOR
Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure. Their malady convinces
The great assay of art, but at his touch
(Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand)
They presently amend.

MALCOLM  I thank you, doctor.
[Doctor exits.]

MACDUFF
What's the disease he means?

MALCOLM  'Tis called the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king,
Which often since my here-remain in England
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven
Himself best knows, but strangely visited people
All swoll'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers; and, 'tis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
And sundry blessings hang about his throne
That speak him full of grace.

[Enter Ross.]


MACDUFF  See who comes here.

MALCOLM
My countryman, but yet I know him not.

MACDUFF
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM
I know him now.--Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!

ROSS  Sir, amen.

MACDUFF
Stands Scotland where it did?

ROSS  Alas, poor country,
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
Is there scarce asked for who, and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.

MACDUFF
O relation too nice and yet too true!

MALCOLM  What's the newest grief?

ROSS
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker.
Each minute teems a new one.

MACDUFF  How does my wife?

ROSS  Why, well.

MACDUFF  And all my children?

ROSS  Well too.

MACDUFF
The tyrant has not battered at their peace?

ROSS
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

MACDUFF
Be not a niggard of your speech. How goes 't?

ROSS
When I came hither to transport the tidings
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses.

MALCOLM  Be 't their comfort
We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.

ROSS  Would I could answer
This comfort with the like. But I have words
That would be howled out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF  What concern
they--
The general cause, or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?

ROSS  No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe, though the main part
Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF  If it be mine,
Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.

ROSS
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF  Hum! I guess at it.

ROSS
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes
Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner
Were on the quarry of these murdered deer
To add the death of you.

MALCOLM  Merciful heaven!--
What, man, ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.

MACDUFF  My children too?

ROSS
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.

MACDUFF
And I must be from thence? My wife killed too?

ROSS  I have said.

MALCOLM  Be comforted.
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge
To cure this deadly grief.

MACDUFF
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say "all"? O hell-kite! All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?

MALCOLM  Dispute it like a man.

MACDUFF  I shall do so,
But I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot but remember such things were
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.

MALCOLM
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.

MACDUFF
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission! Front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Within my sword's length set him. If he 'scape,
Heaven forgive him too.

MALCOLM  This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you
may.
The night is long that never finds the day.
[They exit.]


ACT 5
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.]


DOCTOR  I have two nights watched with you but can
perceive no truth in your report. When was it she
last walked?

GENTLEWOMAN  Since his Majesty went into the field, I
have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown
upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,
fold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and
again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast
sleep.

DOCTOR  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at
once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
watching. In this slumb'ry agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what at any
time have you heard her say?

GENTLEWOMAN  That, sir, which I will not report after
her.

DOCTOR  You may to me, and 'tis most meet you
should.

GENTLEWOMAN  Neither to you nor anyone, having no
witness to confirm my speech.

[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.]

Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,
upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

DOCTOR  How came she by that light?

GENTLEWOMAN  Why, it stood by her. She has light by
her continually. 'Tis her command.

DOCTOR  You see her eyes are open.

GENTLEWOMAN  Ay, but their sense are shut.

DOCTOR  What is it she does now? Look how she rubs
her hands.

GENTLEWOMAN  It is an accustomed action with her to
seem thus washing her hands. I have known her
continue in this a quarter of an hour.

LADY_MACBETH  Yet here's a spot.

DOCTOR  Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes
from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more
strongly.

LADY_MACBETH  Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.
Why then, 'tis time to do 't. Hell is murky. Fie, my
lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear
who knows it, when none can call our power to
account? Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him?

DOCTOR  Do you mark that?

LADY_MACBETH  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is
she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No
more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all
with this starting.

DOCTOR  Go to, go to. You have known what you should
not.

GENTLEWOMAN  She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has
known.

LADY_MACBETH  Here's the smell of the blood still. All
the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. O, O, O!

DOCTOR  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely
charged.

GENTLEWOMAN  I would not have such a heart in my
bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

DOCTOR  Well, well, well.

GENTLEWOMAN  Pray God it be, sir.

DOCTOR  This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have
known those which have walked in their sleep,
who have died holily in their beds.

LADY_MACBETH  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's
buried; he cannot come out on 's grave.

DOCTOR  Even so?

LADY_MACBETH  To bed, to bed. There's knocking at the
gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your
hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to
bed, to bed.	[Lady Macbeth exits.]

DOCTOR  Will she go now to bed?

GENTLEWOMAN  Directly.

DOCTOR
Foul whisp'rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all. Look after her.
Remove from her the means of all annoyance
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night.
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think but dare not speak.

GENTLEWOMAN  Good night, good doctor.
[They exit.]

Scene 2
=======
[Drum and Colors. Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus,
Lennox, and Soldiers.]


MENTEITH
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS  Near Birnam Wood
Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.

CAITHNESS
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX
For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file
Of all the gentry. There is Siward's son
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH  What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury. But for certain
He cannot buckle his distempered cause
Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS  Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH  Who, then, shall blame
His pestered senses to recoil and start
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS  Well, march we on
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed.
Meet we the med'cine of the sickly weal,
And with him pour we in our country's purge
Each drop of us.

LENNOX  Or so much as it needs
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
[They exit marching.]

Scene 3
=======
[Enter Macbeth, the Doctor, and Attendants.]


MACBETH
Bring me no more reports. Let them fly all.
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
"Fear not, Macbeth. No man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly, false
thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures.
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

[Enter Servant.]

The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose-look?

SERVANT  There is ten thousand--

MACBETH  Geese, villain?

SERVANT  Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-livered boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

SERVANT  The English force, so please you.

MACBETH
Take thy face hence.	[Servant exits.]
Seyton!--I am sick at heart
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough. My way of life
Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf,
And that which should accompany old age,
As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have, but in their stead
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare
not.--
Seyton!

[Enter Seyton.]


SEYTON
What's your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH  What news more?

SEYTON
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Give me my armor.

SEYTON  'Tis not needed yet.

MACBETH  I'll put it on.
Send out more horses. Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine
armor.--
How does your patient, doctor?

DOCTOR  Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies
That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH  Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

DOCTOR  Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

MACBETH
Throw physic to the dogs. I'll none of it.--
Come, put mine armor on. Give me my staff.
[Attendants begin to arm him.]
Seyton, send out.--Doctor, the thanes fly from
me.--
Come, sir, dispatch.--If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo
That should applaud again.--Pull 't off, I say.--
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of
them?

DOCTOR
Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

MACBETH  Bring it after me.--
I will not be afraid of death and bane
Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.

DOCTOR, [aside]
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.
[They exit.]

Scene 4
=======
[Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff,
Siward's son, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, and Soldiers,
marching.]


MALCOLM
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH  We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD
What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH  The Wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear 't before him. Thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.

SOLDIER  It shall be done.

SIWARD
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Our setting down before 't.

MALCOLM  'Tis his main hope;
For, where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF  Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD  The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
Towards which, advance the war.
[They exit marching.]

Scene 5
=======
[Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with Drum and
Colors.]


MACBETH
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still "They come!" Our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be
ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
[A cry within of women.]
What is that noise?

SEYTON
It is the cry of women, my good lord.	[He exits.]

MACBETH
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been my senses would have cooled
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in 't. I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.

[Enter Seyton.]

Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON  The Queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH  She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

[Enter a Messenger.]

Thou com'st to use thy tongue: thy story quickly.

MESSENGER  Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do 't.

MACBETH  Well, say, sir.

MESSENGER
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought
The Wood began to move.

MACBETH  Liar and slave!

MESSENGER
Let me endure your wrath if 't be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming.
I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH  If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive
Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.--
I pull in resolution and begin
To doubt th' equivocation of the fiend,
That lies like truth. "Fear not till Birnam Wood
Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane.--Arm, arm, and out!--
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun
And wish th' estate o' th' world were now
undone.--
Ring the alarum bell!--Blow wind, come wrack,
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
[They exit.]

Scene 6
=======
[Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and
their army, with boughs.]


MALCOLM
Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down
And show like those you are.--You, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.

SIWARD  Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
[They exit.]
[Alarums continued.]

Scene 7
=======
[Enter Macbeth.]


MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.

[Enter young Siward.]


YOUNG_SIWARD  What is thy name?

MACBETH  Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG_SIWARD
No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.

MACBETH  My name's Macbeth.

YOUNG_SIWARD
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH  No, nor more fearful.

YOUNG_SIWARD
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
[They fight, and young Siward is slain.]

MACBETH  Thou wast born of
woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandished by man that's of a woman born.
[He exits.]

[Alarums. Enter Macduff.]


MACDUFF
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,
And more I beg not.	[He exits. Alarums.]

[Enter Malcolm and Siward.]


SIWARD
This way, my lord. The castle's gently rendered.
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.

MALCOLM  We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

SIWARD  Enter, sir, the castle.
[They exit. Alarum.]

Scene 8
=======
[Enter Macbeth.]


MACBETH
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.

[Enter Macduff.]


MACDUFF  Turn, hellhound, turn!

MACBETH
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back. My soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF  I have no words;
My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out.	[Fight. Alarum.]

MACBETH  Thou losest labor.
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
To one of woman born.

MACDUFF  Despair thy charm,
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripped.

MACBETH
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cowed my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
That palter with us in a double sense,
That keep the word of promise to our ear
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF  Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time.
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole, and underwrit
"Here may you see the tyrant."

MACBETH  I will not yield
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damned be him that first cries "Hold! Enough!"
[They exit fighting. Alarums.]

[They enter fighting, and Macbeth is slain. Macduff
exits carrying off Macbeth's body. Retreat and flourish.
Enter, with Drum and Colors, Malcolm, Siward, Ross,
Thanes, and Soldiers.]


MALCOLM
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

SIWARD
Some must go off; and yet by these I see
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
He only lived but till he was a man,
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.

SIWARD  Then he is dead?

ROSS
Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.

SIWARD  Had he his hurts before?

ROSS
Ay, on the front.

SIWARD  Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death;
And so his knell is knolled.

MALCOLM
He's worth more sorrow, and that I'll spend for
him.

SIWARD  He's worth no more.
They say he parted well and paid his score,
And so, God be with him. Here comes newer
comfort.

[Enter Macduff with Macbeth's head.]


MACDUFF
Hail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands
Th' usurper's cursed head. The time is free.
I see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds,
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL  Hail, King of Scotland!	[Flourish.]

MALCOLM
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
And make us even with you. My thanes and
kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honor named. What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
(Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands,
Took off her life)--this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of grace,
We will perform in measure, time, and place.
So thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
[Flourish. All exit.]
